                <h3>MY side</h3>
                <p>Ok. Im lowkey shivering in my boots typing this but it has to be said. Lets start from the VERYYY beginning, If you can remember when i asked you to go to the volleyball game after school and you couldnt go. My smartass didnt want to back out cuz i was already hella deep into it and shit. I asked Jack Kelso if he could go so i wasnt lonley and shit and he showed up. He didnt know it was Hillcrest (the team) and his girlfriends friend went there so he started to text her because he wanted to know if it was her or not. Iris (jacks girlfriend) confirms its her and shit. The whole time i felt uncomfortable to be there cuz it just felt really wrong. I go home and live my life and stuff then 3-5 days later i get a text from jack saying that iris wants a picture of you. I asked why then he said iris's friend wanted to see you, so i message iris asking why and she said a girl named Presley thinks im cute. So i message Presley asking why she wants a picture of you and she of course dosnt know. so im a little awkward at the start then we start to text. nothing crazy but we are texting then she gets flirty and shit. idk what to do so im js awkward with it and then i guess i started to miss you and no ones ever gave me attention besides from school and she would be my only notification. So we start to talk and then at some point I started to flirt back. She knew i was dating you at the time so idk what she was doing. after like 1-2 of talking with her i cut her off. never talked to her again, i told you I used chat gpt to tell her i was dating someone and my retarded ass didnt read over it and it said that presley was my girlfriend and when i finally read over it me and her had already stopped talking. she got what i was saying and I was not putting in effort into her.</p>
